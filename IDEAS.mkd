# Things we can do

## Not apathetic 2.0

Provide a forum for those who don't vote for a reason to express their opinions.

* Do the work to review the data from last time.

## 'None of the above' as a service

Everyone wants 'none of the above' on the voting ballot.  Provide a web service that just offers this.

## PPC* survey 2.0

Like Democracy Club did before.  


## Data services

### PPC -> Constituency lookup.

MaPit/PoPit install with PPC data included.

### Election history service. 

Vote breakdown by constituency, historically.  Needs to deal logically with boundary change.
